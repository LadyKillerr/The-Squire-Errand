# The-Squire-Errand
a 2D platformer game that was built mainly for educational purposes, and also as one of my hobbies.
# Story
- You are a squire, and hopefully an honored knight in the near future, but to achieve that, you must finish one last task as a test. Slay the Baron...
- To do so, you must infiltrate his castle, full of goons and demons of all kinds. Run through them or kill them is your choice, but remember, the more monsters you slay, the safer your path.
- Act fast, the moment you enter the baron's castle, he knows you're coming, so don't take too long, or the Baron will escape...
- Make haste and good use of your only ally - your trusty bow.


## What i learned during the making of this game: 
- Learned the fundamentals of Unity tilemap, it's layers...

- Using prefabs and how to utilize them for multiple scenes without having to recreate
