# The-Squire-Errand
a 2D platformer game that was built mainly for educational purposes, and also as one of my hobbies.
# Story
- You are a squire, and hopefully an honored knight shortly, but to achieve that, you must finish one last task as a test. Slay the Baron...
- To do so, you must infiltrate his castle, full of goons and demons of all kinds. Run through them or kill them is your choice, but remember, the more monsters you slay, the safer your path.
- Act fast, the moment you enter the baron's castle, he knows you're coming, so don't take too long, or the Baron will escape...
- Make haste and good use of your only ally - your trusty bow.


## What I learned during the making of this game: 
- Learned the fundamentals of Unity tilemap and its layers...
- Created Animation characters, Animation States, and Transitions condition
- Using prefabs and how to utilize them for multiple scenes without having to recreate
- Composite Collider and how to make ground tilemap looks fit nicely
- Setup Unity's new input system
- Adding player horizontal movement and how to flip the player sprite depends on the input
- Using Cinemachine follow cameras and State-Driven Cameras to better the gameplay
- Setup enemy, including animations, AI patrol, mortality, enemy lives
- Create basic hazards like spikes and water, added player death animation and sound
- Implement arrows and bow(weapons for the player), instantiate bullets, add bullet sounds, fire sounds
- Added Game Session, Coins, Persistent data, and Scene Persist using the singleton pattern
## And so many more that I have yet to list, I hope you enjoy it!
